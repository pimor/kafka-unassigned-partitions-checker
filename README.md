Kafka consumer group monitor that reports missing partition assignments for consumer groups in a Kafka cluster

### Coding challenge specifications:

Write a Kafka consumer group monitor that reports missing partition assignments for consumer groups in a Kafka cluster. See below for further details on the coding task.
- Please submit code as if you intended to ship it to production.
- Tests are expected.
- Weâ€™d recommend you use Scala or Java.
- You can assume to have a Kafka cluster in version 0.10.2.
- Please include a description of your solution and rate the scalability
- We will discuss your solution in a follow-up Technical Interview onsite.

#### Coding Challenge details:
For simplicity, missing offsets should be printed to standard output.
We assume that all consumers store their offsets in Kafka, so that they can be retrieved via the Kafka Admin client.

The following scenarios should be considered:
1. Assume the cluster has a consumer group g1 and a topic t1 with two partitions. Offsets for g1 and both partitions t1-0 and t1-1 are stored in Kafka, so no missing offsets should be reported.
2. Assume the cluster has a consumer group g1 and a topic t1 with two partitions. The consumer group g1 uses manual partition assignment, and consumes from partition t1-0 only. In this case, missing offsets for topic partition t1-1 should be reported.
3. Assume the cluster has two consumer groups g1 and g2, and topics t1 and t2 with one partition each. g1 has offsets for partition t1-0, g2 has offsets for partition t2-0. In this case, no missing offsets for g1 and t2-0 should be reported (as g1 is consuming from topic t1 only), and neither should for g2 and t1-0.

> **Note:**
> - In general, all consumer groups with offsets stored in Kafka should be monitored**
> - The topics to be monitored should be configurable.**

## Checking out and building:
To check out the project and build from source, do the following:

    git clone git@github.com:pimor/kafka-unassigned-partitions-checker.git
    cd kafka-unassigned-partitions-checker
    mvn clean verify

## How to run it:
Just run the jar under the target/ folder.
>Example:

    java -jar target/kafka-unassigned-partitions-checker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

## Solution details:
It's a Spring Boot application that requires Java 7/8 and Maven 3.3.9. It also provides the following features:
- spring-kafka-test enables the testing without a local Kafka/Zookeeper installation because it runs automatically an
embedded instance to execute the tests.
- the main process is executed as a daemon, with a scheduling time of 60 seconds.
- Spring profiles can be used to manage different configurations in a easy way.
- Kafka brokers URL and topic names to monitor can be changed editing the application.yml file and updating the
bootstrap-servers and topics-to-check properties. *Note: All the consumers will be monitor when the topics-to-check
property has no values.*

### Implementation details:
Basically, it builds two main structures which are used to compare the topic partitions and the consumer partitions:

- **Topic partitions structure:**
It's a simple Map that stores the topic as key and the partitions as value.
The design of this structure is the following:

> [topic,{partitions}]

- **Consumer partitions structure:**
Taking into account that some topics shouldn't be monitored, it creates a structure (Java Map) that retrieves all the
partitions for a specific consumer within a consumer group and topic. The key is compound by the topic and consumer group
and the value is other Map with the topic as key and the partitions as value. The special character '#' is used as
separator. The design of this structure is the following:

>[topic#consumer-group,[topic, {partitions}]]

Both structures are used by a comparator class that will use the topic key to search the missing consumer partitions
using the topic partitions information. A log message is printed and wrote in the log if the method detects some
misconfigured consumer (it has assigned itself less partitions than the topic partitions number).

Kafka AdminClient and KafkaTemplate classes provide all the consumer and topics details.

>**Note:** Only partitions with consumer groups will be scan.

### Scalability analysis
One of the reasons because Spring Boot was chosen is to achieve horizontal scalability in a easy and quick way when the
capacity requirements need that the applications increase their power in order to satisfy KPIs.
This framework enables the micro service deployments which are a very good option to scale the application
performance. In this sense, for example, many instances can be deployed after make a small application change,
letting to each instance works with a topic subset, so the overall task is broken into smaller pieces.
Cloud environments like GCP, AWS or OpenShift are very recommended to deploy and scale this kind of applications.
This solution doesn't implement multi-threading because the operations are light. Nevertheless this is a good approach
to scale the app if, at some point, the number of topics causes a performance degradation.

As the number of topics/consumers can cause a performance degradation because it'll take more analysis time, a
combination of number of instances and job split will help to stabilise and recover the performance again.
